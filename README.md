### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is ThÃ©o Gianella. I'm a former PhD candidate in French literature and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm wrapping up a bootcamp in web development at The Hacking Project. I am very curious about all fields of development and am looking to widen my skillset, with a preference for back-end and DevOps !

Right now I'm working on my first Node.js package : a small CLI program to easily and smoothly create new React components. Apart from that I am actively learning Rust !
