### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is ThÃ©o Gianella. I'm a former PhD candidate in French literature and aspiring developer. I freshly completed a 6 months bootcamp in web development at The Hacking Project. I am very curious about all fields of development and am looking to widen my skillset, with a preference for back-end and DevOps !

I freshly released my (humble) first npm package : a small CLI program to easily and smoothly create new React components. You can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tgianella/create-react-component-cli) ! :tada:

Apart from that I am currently learning Rust :crab: and WebAssembly, hit me up with any tips or feedback on my projects !
