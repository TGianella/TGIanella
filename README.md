### Hi there 👋

My name is Théo Gianella. I'm a former professor of French literature and upcoming developer, having completed a 6 months bootcamp in web development. I just started my first job as a junior JS developer at [Zenika](https://www.zenika.com/) in Lyon !

Currently I am working on honing my JS and React skills, hit me up with any tips or advice you might have ! 📖
