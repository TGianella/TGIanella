### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is ThÃ©o Gianella. I'm a former PhD candidate in French literature and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm wrapping up a bootcamp in web development at The Hacking Project. Right now I'm looking to broaden my experience in all kind of fields, with a preference for back-end.
